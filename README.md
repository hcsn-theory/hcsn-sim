## Overview

HCSN proposes a discrete, causal, and computational substrate:
- Events are vertices in a hypergraph; relations are (hyper)edges.
- Dynamics are local rewrite rules (edge creation, vertex fusion).
- Geometry, dimension, and time are emergent, not fundamental.

The long-term goal is to identify the minimal rule set that produces universes consistent with:
- Lorentz invariance (emergent)
- 4D spacetime structures
- Holographic scaling of information
- Quantum probabilistic behavior (Born rule)

## Core Principles (Axioms) 🧭

| Axiom | Name | Summary |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Discreteness | Reality is discrete — events (vertices) are fundamental. |
| 2 | Causality | Events are partially ordered by causal relations. |
| 3 | Minimal Dynamics | Local rewrite rules drive evolution: Edge Creation & Vertex Fusion. |
| 4 | Holography | Information capacity scales with boundary (not volume). |
| 5 | Geometricity | Stable geometry emerges when ⟨k⟩ ≈ 8 (a dimensional attractor). |
| 6 | Persistence | Hierarchical stability & error-correction via redundant causal loops. |

## Quick Start 🚀

Requirements
- Python 3.10 or later
- No external dependencies by default (pure Python). If notebooks or plotting are used, consider: matplotlib, numpy, jupyter.

Clone and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hcsn-theory/HCSN-Theory.git
cd HCSN-Theory
python3 run_simulation.py
```

This runs a toy universe and prints diagnostics every N steps (see config/flags in the engine if present).

---

## How to Run a Toy Universe ▶️

1. Configure parameters (if available) in `engine` or via command-line flags.
2. Start the simulation:
   - `python3 run_simulation.py`
3. Key printed diagnostics (periodic):
   - average coordination ⟨k⟩
   - causal depth (L)
   - interaction concentration (Φ)
   - closure density (Ψ)
   - hierarchical stability (Ω)

Tip: Increase logging or enable snapshotting in `rewrite_engine.py` for analysis and visualization.

## Diagnostics Explained 🧪

| Symbol | Name | Meaning |
|:------:|------|--------|
| ⟨k⟩ | Avg coordination | Controls effective dimensionality; geometric attractor near 8. |
| L | Causal depth | Maximum causal chain length — emergent time scale. |
| Φ | Interaction concentration | Measures hub dominance (want small Φ for uniformity). |
| Ψ | Closure density | Redundancy in causal closure (error correction). |
| Ω | Hierarchical closure | RG-like stability across scales (non-zero indicates persistence). |

Interpretation guide:
- ⟨k⟩ ≈ 7.5–8.5 → spacetime-like, stable geometry.
- Small Φ → suppressed hubs, more uniform interactions.
- Non-zero Ω across scales → hierarchical persistence and robustness.

## Stable Spacetime-Like Behavior ✅

Empirical indicators in simulations:
- ⟨k⟩ stabilizes near 7.5–8.5
- Φ remains small (no runaway hub formation)
- Ω > 0 across multiple scales
- Closure density Ψ indicates sufficient redundancy for persistent structure

Negative results (failures) are equally valuable — they highlight missing axioms or rule constraints.

## Current Research Focus 🔬

Active directions:
- Prevent metric collapse under coarse-graining
- Implement logarithmic information metrics (holographic tests)
- Enforce holographic bounds dynamically in evolution
- Search for Lorentz-invariant fixed points of the rule dynamics
- Explore mechanisms that produce quantum probabilistic outcomes (Born rule)

## Contributing — How to Help 🤝

We welcome contributions from:
- physicists (GR, QFT, quantum gravity)
- mathematicians (graph theory, category theory)
- programmers (simulation performance, visualization)
- curious minds who can test assumptions

Getting started:
1. Fork the repo, create a feature branch.
2. Add reproducible experiments under `experiments/`.
3. Document new rules, diagnostics, and observed behaviors.
4. Open PRs with clear descriptions, expected behavior, and reproducibility notes.

Guidelines:
- Write reproducible code and seed RNGs where appropriate.
- Add tests or small example scripts demonstrating changes.
- Keep changes modular — new rules or observables should live in `engine/`.

Philosophy
> “The universe may not be described by computation — it may be computation.”
---
HCSN treats this as a testable hypothesis: build minimal computational rules and examine what emerges.

Enjoy exploring! 🧩
